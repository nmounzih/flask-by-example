# flask-by-example

Currently following this [Flask By Example tutorial](https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/) to learn Flask and Angular. I do not take any credit for any of the code here, I am just trying to learn Flask/Angular for the first time. Planning to personalize once core concepts are achieved.
